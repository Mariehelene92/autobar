# Autobar

## Setup
Project for python3.5

## Sanity check
 - combine doses of same ingredient (look out for number field)
 - no 0.0 quantity for regular ingredients
 - eliminate pictures not in DB
 - add fixtures with verified mixes
 - manually add all mixes with most common alcohol
 - set volume to shot (big, small...)
 - script to verify mix with online info
